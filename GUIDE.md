Got it — you want **step-by-step**, **realistic**, **no-theory**, **exactly how to actually migrate** the architecture you have (Flask + Redis + Chunker/Processor/Assembler + React) **to AWS**.

I'll walk you through it **like a cloud engineer would plan an actual migration**. 🚀

---

# 📋 Full Step-by-Step Migration Plan

---

# 1. 🎯 **Understand your Current Architecture**

| Component | Type | |
|:---|:---|:---|
| React Frontend | Static site | built by Vite |
| Flask Backend | API server | accepts uploads, talks to Redis |
| Chunker Service | Worker | listens to chunking queue |
| Processor Service | Worker | listens to processing queue |
| Assembler Service | Worker | listens to assembly queue |
| Redis | Queue Broker | communication between services |
| Folders (temp_uploads etc.) | Local storage | for intermediate files |

✅ You have **clear boundaries** between services.
✅ Everything is Dockerized.
✅ Perfect for cloud-native migration.

---

# 2. 🛠 **Core Migration Strategy (AWS Services)**

| Local | AWS Equivalent |
|:---|:---|
| Dockerized services | Amazon ECS (Fargate mode) |
| Redis server | Amazon ElastiCache for Redis |
| Local folders for uploads/chunks/final videos | Amazon S3 buckets |
| Static React site | Amazon S3 (Static Site Hosting) + CloudFront |
| Internal network between services | Amazon VPC |

---

# 3. 🚚 **Migration Steps (Detailed Execution)**

---

### Step 1: Create ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

> ECR is AWS's docker image repository.

- **Create ECR Repositories**:
  - `backend`
  - `chunker`
  - `processor`
  - `assembler`

- **Tag and Push Images**:

```bash
# Example for backend
docker build -t backend .
docker tag backend:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/backend:latest
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/backend:latest
```

✅ Now your docker images are ready in AWS.

---

### Step 2: Setup Amazon VPC

- Create a **private VPC** (or reuse default)
- Inside the VPC:
  - 2 public subnets (for Load Balancer + frontend if needed)
  - 2 private subnets (for backend/services + Redis)
- Set up security groups to allow only internal traffic between services.

✅ You now have network isolation.

---

### Step 3: Set up ElastiCache for Redis

- Launch an **ElastiCache Redis** cluster inside your private subnet.
- Ensure no public access — only internal to ECS services.

✅ This will be your `chunking_jobs`, `processing_jobs`, `assembly_jobs` queue broker.

---

### Step 4: Set up S3 Buckets

| Bucket Name | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `video-platform-temp-uploads` | Upload videos here |
| `video-platform-unprocessed-chunks` | Store raw chunks |
| `video-platform-processed-chunks` | Store processed chunks |
| `video-platform-final-videos` | Store final assembled videos |
| `video-platform-frontend` | Host React frontend |

✅ Buckets must be public/private appropriately (only frontend bucket public).

---

### Step 5: Update Your Code

Instead of saving files locally, change:

| Action | Code Change Needed |
|:---|:---|
| Upload video | Save video directly into S3 bucket (`temp_uploads`) |
| Chunker reads | Download video from S3 to container local tmp dir |
| Chunker writes chunks | Upload chunks to S3 `unprocessed_chunks` bucket |
| Processor reads chunks | Download chunk from S3 |
| Processor writes processed chunk | Upload to S3 `processed_chunks` |
| Assembler reads processed chunks | Download all chunks from S3 |
| Assembler writes final video | Upload to S3 `final_videos` bucket |

Use Python’s `boto3` library:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
# Example: Download
s3.download_file('bucket-name', 'key', 'local-path')

# Example: Upload
s3.upload_file('local-path', 'bucket-name', 'key')
```

✅ Now services become "stateless" — much better for cloud.

---

### Step 6: Deploy ECS Cluster (Fargate)

- Create a new ECS Cluster (Fargate launch type)
- **Create Services**:
  - `backend-service`
  - `chunker-service`
  - `processor-service` (desired count = 5 for scalability)
  - `assembler-service`

Each Service:

- Pulls Docker image from ECR
- Connects to the same VPC
- Connects to ElastiCache Redis
- Mounts IAM Role with S3 access permissions

✅ Now your microservices are running fully serverless.

---

### Step 7: Deploy React Frontend

- Build your frontend: `npm run build`
- Upload `/dist/` to `video-platform-frontend` S3 bucket.
- Enable Static Website Hosting on S3.
- Create a CloudFront distribution to point to the S3 frontend bucket.
- (Optional) Use Route53 for domain like `video-platform.com`.

✅ Now your UI is public, fast, and highly available.

---

### Step 8: Set up IAM Roles and Permissions

| Service | Permission Needed |
|:---|:---|
| Backend Service | Write to S3 (temp_uploads) |
| Chunker Service | Read temp_uploads, write unprocessed_chunks |
| Processor Service | Read unprocessed_chunks, write processed_chunks |
| Assembler Service | Read processed_chunks, write final_videos |
| All Services | Access ElastiCache |

✅ Create least-privilege roles.

---

### Step 9: Test End-to-End

1. Upload a video from frontend
2. Check video lands in `temp_uploads` S3 bucket
3. Chunker gets triggered from Redis queue
4. Processor containers pick chunks, compress, save to S3
5. Assembler assembles and uploads final video to `final_videos` bucket
6. Frontend can display final video download link

✅ 🎯 Full cloud pipeline operational!
